# RPG-Game

<h1>My first java project : RPG Game</h1>

<p>In order to learn Java for ESIEE Paris, I decided to follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gravenilvectuto">Graven</a>'s Java Tutorial about all the fundamentals of Java language. And I have to say, since I am kind of used to Python and JavaScript concepts, I didn't had issues trying to figure out how it actually works. Java is fun !</p>

<h1>What this project is about ?</h1>

<p>
  It's a basic collect and battle game, nothing special. Just to get familiar with Java, more project in coming furthermore.
