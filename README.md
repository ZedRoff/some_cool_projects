# some_cool_projects

Ideas : 

- Todo List (typical first project lmao)
- Calculator (like the one in windows)
- Math Solver (Math online expression solver (linear / non-linear / polynomial / approximating) solutions.
- Plus random que random (in english, more random than random, I don't know what this will become)
- Palette generator (like coloors.co)
- Piano (like the one you see in youtube)
- Toolbox extension (an extension with many fun/random stuff just to learn how to code extension tho)
- hastebin clone
- google home (kind of simpler than that, but the idea is to learn how to take a voice, and transform it into a string, and talk with a browser)
- form creator (kind of like google forms)
- how to become a better developer page
- full of easter egg website (something like an adventure)
- clock
- quizz app
- math for fun
